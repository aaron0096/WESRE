What is an incident:
An unplanned interruption of a service, or reduction in the quality of a service.

It can take the form of:
Hardware failure, Software updates, Configuration changes, Accidental events, Malicious attacks

Incident Management plan is a structured approach to incident response.
Prolonged major incident can be costly in terms of revenue and reputation.
With a process in place, the repair time can be reduced, and also reducing revenue loss.
Especially important if company is global, then there can be multiple teams with different timezones.
Need for handoff to another team; need for higher level coordination and communication, and maybe a single point of control at any time.

Plan involves clearly defining a chain of command, provide a systematic procedure to follow, with flexibility to handle unique incidents.
Clear focus on recovery of the business capabilities, while capturing data for continuous improvement.

For a plan to be effective, use more common terms, reduce acronyms and jargons. If really intend to use, better to provide a glossary section.
Makes message clearer, and sometimes if the team not same country, maybe will have communication problem.

Recommended for a team, to have a 1:5 ratio for leader:follower.
Roles would be:
1. Incident Commander. First to be filled. Overall in charge of delegating tasks for roles 2-5.
2. Scribe. Records actions and minutes, assists IC. Goal is to capture the information for future reference.
3. Operations Lead. Works to find out cause of incident. Ensures only Ops team does the fixing. Brings in Subject Matter Experts to assist.
4. Communications Lead. Works to disseminate information, both internal and external. Tools are social media or chats (discord, slack)
5. Planning Lead. Capture long-term issues, arranges for handoff. Supports OL and IC.

SMEs are usually on-call, may not normally be involved in operations. Can help with providiing knowledge.

So the incident is done now.
Postmortem involves a written report to capture the data of everything important that occurred as a result of the incident.
