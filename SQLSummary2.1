SQL Overview
SQL uses certain syntax that if entered incorrectly will not give results. Not unlike other programming languages.
However it's not so strict with certain things like tab indentation or capitalisation of words. You will still want to capitalise for easier reading for yourself.

Select statement is shown as below.

SELECT field1, field1, field3   ## Don't need brackets in this area or encounter error
FROM table1
WHERE criteria
ORDER BY field1, field2;

Semi-colon at the end means that the query ends here.
Commas are used to seperate objects in a series.


Creating a table syntax.

CREATE TABLE `Client` (
    ClientId CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    BirthDate DATE NULL,
    Address VARCHAR(256) NULL,
    City VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    StateAbbr CHAR(2) NULL,
    PostalCode VARCHAR(10) NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY fk_Client_StateAbbr (StateAbbr)
        REFERENCES State(StateAbbr)
);


Spaces ususally not used in column names. If it is used, it requires quotation marks (just makes it harder to refer to the columns).

One more example from Engage.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Address  
FROM Client
WHERE LastName in ("Smith","Lee");  ## Brackets accepted here
