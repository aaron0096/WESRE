Git is a source code control system
What it allows is for programmers to work on code collaboratively. 

Git allows for 'branching'.
The 'main' branch refers to where all the code and files stay. Also the current files.
Creating a branch means copying all the files into a seperate area. You can then work on these files in the branch without modifying the main branch.
Some benefits include that it won't affect the current working copy of the file if there's uncompleted code.
Once the code is done, then you can merge it onto the main branch, not partially-edited code that can spoil things.

Branching also allows you to pause the current project, and you can move on to working on some other project or hotfixes that crop up.
You also can have multiple branches at the same time, with each branch working on a different project or area.
